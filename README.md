This is a basic but an interesting Python program. This specific type of program is called Geocoding.
Geocoding is basically performed on Geodata(contains coordinates longitudes, latitudes etc.). 
This is called forward geococding. In this code we API. I have used Geoapify (an open source free API).
In this program we enter a specific address and in return we get the longitudes and latitudes from the JSON data.
